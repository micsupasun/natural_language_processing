# Project
multi-label text classification with news categories

# Problem
Multi-label text classification with news categories faces challenges due to ambiguous and context-rich articles, imbalanced data distribution, large vocabulary, noise, and limited training data.

# Solution
we can predict Multi-label text classification with news categories

# Methodology
1. install library
2. import library
3. Import Dataset
4. Data preprocessing
5. Exploratory Data Analysis
6. Feature Engineering(thai stop word and regular expression)
7. train test split
8. Machine Learning with ten models
9. using the best model to predict multi-label text classification with news categories
10. export feature and label, we predict
