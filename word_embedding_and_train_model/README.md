# Objective
1. I studied Word Embeddings: Vectorization, Count Vectorization, TF-IDF, word 2 Vec, Doc 2 Vec, Bert.
2. I studied Recurrent Neural Network to train a model

# Step of work
1. Import Library
2. Import Data
3. Comparative Word Embeddings between Word2vec, Doc2Vec
4. I use Recurrent Neural Network and LSTM to train a model
5. Predict label
6. Export predict label

# Result
I can use Word Embeddings(Word2vec, Doc2Vec) and train model(Recurrent Neural Network and LSTM)
