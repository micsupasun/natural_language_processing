# Natural Language Processing

This project work on Natural Language Processing.

I have completed more than 30 projects related to Natural Language Processing.

The Text Analytics Subject at the University of Essex. It makes me interested in the science of character prediction because, in Thailand, it is much more challenging to predict characters than in English. After all, the words are not separated by spacing. In the first step, I studied word extraction and text cleaning by removing special characters, removing stop words, stemming, Lemmatization, and Tokenization. After that, I studied embedding: Vectorization, Count Vectorization, TF-IDF, word 2 Vec, Doc 2 Vec, Bert. From the study, I realized that the best predictors are models that can accurately predict probabilities: Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, eXtreme Gradient Boosting in machine learning, and RNN, RNN-GRU in deep learning.

As an accomplished and dynamic professional specializing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data extraction, I have pioneered innovative solutions to complex problems. My extensive experience spans Extreme Multi-label Text Classification, Document Classification, Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition, and Part of Speech Tagging across diverse languages and applications. I am adept in harnessing the power of cutting-edge tools and technologies like BERT NLP, NLTK, Spacy, PyThaiNLP, and others to develop state-of-the-art systems that effectively perform automated text tagging, recommendation, classification, and more. My expertise extends to Twitter text classification, where I have developed sophisticated visualizations, representations, and prediction models to track and analyze conversations around critical topics like Coronavirus. Additionally, I have successfully developed custom BERT NLP models for text classification and question answering, further proving my skillset's adaptability. I have successfully developed visualization models, including word clouds, to depict the frequency or importance of words, assisting in identifying key themes or topics.
Regarding document classification, my proficiency in applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation for unsupervised topic discovery and Sentiment Analysis for automatic sentiment categorization has allowed me to deliver top-notch analytical solutions for decision-making and opinion analysis. Expanding on this, my competence in Named Entity Recognition has resulted in developing systems that can automatically identify and classify entities in both English and Thai. Furthermore, my robust knowledge of Machine Learning and Deep Learning has been instrumental in predicting Part of Speech tagging with impressive accuracy. Recognizing the importance of data, I have harnessed tools like BeautifulSoup and Selenium for effective data scraping, extraction, and cleaning from various web sources in both English and Thai languages. My success in these endeavors is reflected in the fruitful scraping and structuring of data from multiple news websites. Beyond textual data, my prowess extends to working with auditory information. I have developed custom text-to-speech systems and leveraged pre-training frameworks like NeMo Tools, enhancing the quality and naturalness of synthetic speech. I have also demonstrated an exceptional ability in word embedding and model training, as well as creating custom word embeddings using specific datasets. My knowledge and application of NLP are not confined to the back end but extend to user-facing applications. I have built chatbots powered by Dialogflow for real-world projects, providing tangible value to businesses. Driven by my passion for excellence and innovation, I continue to challenge the status quo, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with Natural Language Processing and data extraction. My comprehensive skills and relentless pursuit of knowledge position me not just to meet the industry's evolving demands but redefine them.
