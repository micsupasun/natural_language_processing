# Natural Language Processing

This project work about Natural Language Processing.

The Text Analytics Subject at the University of Essex. It makes me interested in the science of character prediction because, in Thailand, it is much more challenging to predict characters than in English because the words are not separated by spacing. In the first step, I studied word extraction and text cleaning by removing special characters, removing stop words, stemming, Lemmatization, and Tokenization. After that, I studied embedding: Vectorization, Count Vectorization, TF-IDF, word 2 Vec, Doc 2 Vec, Bert. From the study, I realized that the best predictors are models that can accurately predict probabilities: Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, eXtreme Gradient Boosting in machine learning, and RNN, RNN-GRU in deep learning.

7. Scrape data
 - [scrape data with beautiful soup](https://github.com/micsupasun/natural_language_processing/blob/main/scrape_data/scrape_data_basic_beautiful_soup/README.md) extracting the desired data from the HTML structure. This could include text content, attribute values, links, images, tables, or any other information embedded in the HTML
 - [scrape lottery with beautiful soup](https://github.com/micsupasun/natural_language_processing/blob/main/scrape_data/scrape_data_historical_lotto_beautiful_soup/README.md) extracting and scrape lottery with beautiful soup.
 - [scrape data with selenium](https://github.com/micsupasun/natural_language_processing/blob/main/scrape_data/scrape_data_basic_selenium/README.md) can log in and scrape inside login pages.
