# Natural Language Processing

This project work about Natural Language Processing.

The Text Analytics Subject at the University of Essex. It makes me interested in the science of character prediction because, in Thailand, it is much more challenging to predict characters than in English because the words are not separated by spacing. In the first step, I studied word extraction and text cleaning by removing special characters, removing stop words, stemming, Lemmatization, and Tokenization. After that, I studied embedding: Vectorization, Count Vectorization, TF-IDF, word 2 Vec, Doc 2 Vec, Bert. From the study, I realized that the best predictors are models that can accurately predict probabilities: Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, eXtreme Gradient Boosting in machine learning, and RNN, RNN-GRU in deep learning.

# All of process

1. Transformer
- custom BERT NLP
  -   [Custom Bert NLP for two project](https://github.com/micsupasun/natural_language_processing/blob/main/custom_bert_nlp/custom_bert_2_project/README.md) is custom Bert NLP for work on Text Classification and Thai Question Answering
  -   [Train Bert NLP model for another task](https://github.com/micsupasun/natural_language_processing/blob/main/custom_bert_nlp/custom_bert_nlp/README.md) generate Bert NLP model for work in another task
2. Clean data with thai word
- PythaiNLP
  - [Document classification with 3 project](https://github.com/micsupasun/natural_language_processing/blob/main/document_classification/README.md) predict document classification with 3 project(word cloud, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Sentiment Analysis)

# Project
1. Text Classification
 - [Custom Bert NLP for Text Classification](https://github.com/micsupasun/natural_language_processing/blob/main/custom_bert_nlp/custom_bert_2_project/README.md) is custom Bert NLP for work on Text Classification.
2. Question Answering
 - [Custom Bert NLP for Question Answering](https://github.com/micsupasun/natural_language_processing/blob/main/custom_bert_nlp/custom_bert_2_project/README.md) is custom Bert NLP for Question Answering
3. Gerate Bert model
 - [Train Bert NLP model for another task](https://github.com/micsupasun/natural_language_processing/blob/main/custom_bert_nlp/custom_bert_nlp/README.md) generate Bert NLP model for work in another task
 4. document classification
 - Word Cloud
   - [Document classification with Word Cloud](https://github.com/micsupasun/natural_language_processing/blob/main/document_classification/README.md) Generate a word cloud visualization to visually represent the frequency or importance of words in the text, aiding in identifying key themes or topics.
 - Latent Dirichlet Allocation
   - [Document classification with Latent Dirichlet Allocation](https://github.com/micsupasun/natural_language_processing/blob/main/document_classification/README.md) Apply LDA, a probabilistic model, to automatically discover underlying topics in a document corpus, enabling unsupervised document classification based on topic distributions.
 - Sentiment Analysis
   - [Document classification with Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/micsupasun/natural_language_processing/blob/main/document_classification/README.md) employ sentiment analysis techniques to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories, enabling automated sentiment classification for decision-making or opinion analysis.
