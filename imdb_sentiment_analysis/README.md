# Objective
1. cleansing data with regular expression and stop word
2. split word with word tokenize
3. working word embedding with tfidfvectorizer 
4. predict multiple classification model
5. improve accuracy model by fine-tuning parameter

# Step of work
1. Import Library
2. Import Data
3. Clean data with regular expression
4. Clean data with stop word
5. split word with word tokenize
6. use XGBoost, Random Forest, Naive Bayes,K nearest neighbors, Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithm, Support Vector Machine to train a model
7. improve model by fine-tuning parameter with grid search cv
7. metric model by accuracy and roc curve
8. Export predict label

# Result
improve my skill in text classification(cleansing data,working word embedding with tfidfvectorizer, predict multiple classification model, Improve accuracy model by fine-tuning parameter)
