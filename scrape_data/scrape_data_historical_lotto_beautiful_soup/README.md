# Project
scrape lottery with beautiful soup

# Problem
Scraping data with Beautiful Soup is that the data we want to extract may be embedded within complex HTML structures or spread across multiple pages. Additionally, websites may have varying HTML structures or data formats, making locating and extracting the desired data difficult.

# Solution
The main result is extracting the desired data from the HTML structure. This could include text content, attribute values, links, images, tables, or any other information embedded in the HTML. The extracted data is stored in variables or structures for further processing or analysis.

# Methodology
1. install library
2. import library
3. scrape data with find or find all HTML tags for get lottery data
