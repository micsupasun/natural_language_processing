# Project
scrape data with beautiful soup and selenium

# objective
The objective of scraping data from a website using Beautiful Soup and Selenium is to programmatically extract information from web pages that are not readily available through APIs or structured data formats. This approach allows us to retrieve specific data elements, such as text, tables, images, or links, from the HTML source code of a website. The combination of Beautiful Soup and Selenium provides a powerful solution for web scraping by allowing us to navigate, interact with dynamic web pages, and extract desired data efficiently.

# Solution
Beautiful Soup is primarily used for parsing and extracting data from HTML source code. In contrast, Selenium is used for browser automation and interaction, making it suitable for scraping dynamic websites that rely on JavaScript. We can use Beautiful Soup with Selenium to parse the extracted HTML data and extract specific elements or attributes.
