# Project
cleansing and finding data by regular expression

# Problem
The problem in cleansing and finding data using regular expressions (regex) arises when we have unstructured or semi-structured text data, and we need to extract specific patterns or clean the data by removing unwanted characters, formatting inconsistencies, or noise. Regular expressions provide a powerful tool for pattern matching and manipulation, but constructing effective regex patterns can be challenging, especially when dealing with complex or variable data formats.

# Solution
Identify specific patterns or structures we want to extract or clean in the text data. Construct regex patterns that match the desired patterns and use regex functions or methods to apply them for data extraction or cleansing. Test and validate the regex patterns and cleansing process to ensure accurate results, considering potential edge cases and variations in the data.

# Methodology
1. import library
2. create a sentence
3. use regular expression
