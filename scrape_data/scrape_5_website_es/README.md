# Project
scrape five websites about Thai news websites, including Prachachat, Posttoday, Mthai, Ch3thailand, and Biotechthailand website. Additionally, pull data that I scrape to temp in the Elastic Search database.

# Problem
The project aims to scrape data from five Thai news websites, including Prachachat, Posttoday, Mthai, Ch3thailand, and Biotechthailand. Manually collecting data from multiple websites can be time-consuming. Data from websites might have different formats, leading to data integration and consistency issues.


# Solution
Develop a web scraping script to extract relevant data from specified Thai news websites. Utilize web scraping libraries or tools to collect data from multiple website pages efficiently. Implement an Elastic Search database to store the scraped data temporarily for easy querying and management. Use data transformation and normalization techniques to ensure consistent formatting across the different sources. Set up a scheduled task to periodically run the scraping script and update the Elastic Search database with fresh data.

# Methodology
1. scrape five websites
2. clean data from five websites 
3. pull data to the Elastic Search database
