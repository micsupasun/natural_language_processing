# Project
Thai word segmentation

# Problem
We can separate English words from a sentence by the space bar. However, we do not have a space bar to separate words in Thai words from sentences. Therefore, So we have to use Pythainlp. It is a Thai cut word package to parse words in Thai NLP.

# Solution
we can separate Thai words from the sentence.

# Methodology
1. Install Pythainlp and deepcut library
2. import Pythainlp
3. create sentence
4. We can use Dictionary based for fast work, but low accuracy depends on situations such as longest, mm, newmm, newmm-safe, icu.
5. We can use CNN based for high accuracy, but slow work depends on situations such as deepcut and attacut.
6. In addition, we can use the NECTEC library, but not popular because it has cost to use API
