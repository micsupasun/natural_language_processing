# Project
Clean data and connect website in the real world with Flask and use Thai Soundex to recommend similar words to change the word when data duplicate such as ID or Username.

# Problem
1. Data Duplication: The website needs help with data duplication, particularly fields like ID or Thai Username, which can lead to confusion and errors in user accounts and records.
2. Inefficient Data Management: The presence of duplicate data makes data management challenging and time-consuming for administrators and can result in inaccurate analytics and reporting.
3. User Experience Impact: Data duplication can negatively impact the user experience, leading to potential login issues, loss of data integrity, and frustrated users.
4. Manual Correction Process: Resolving data duplicates involves a manual and labor-intensive process, consuming valuable resources and delaying data updates.
5. Limited Word Recommendations: With an efficient recommendation system, users might be able to find suitable replacements for duplicate words, making it easier to resolve duplication issues effectively.

Solution:
1. Data Cleaning and Deduplication: By implementing a data cleaning process, duplicate entries for critical fields like ID and Thai Username can be identified and eliminated to ensure data accuracy.
2. Flask Web Application: Using Flask, a lightweight web application framework, the website can be connected to process data and manage recommendations efficiently.
3. Thai Soundex Algorithm Integration: Thai Soundex, a phonetic algorithm, can be integrated into the system to recommend similar words, aiding users in finding appropriate replacements for duplicate data entries.
4. Real-time Suggestions: The system can provide real-time suggestions as users enter data, preventing duplication at the point of entry and enhancing data integrity.
5. Automated Correction: With the Flask-based application and Thai Soundex integration, the correction process for data duplication can be automated, reducing manual efforts and streamlining data management.


# Methodology
1. connect flask API and Soundex model
2. connect flask API and website
