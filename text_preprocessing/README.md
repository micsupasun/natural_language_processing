# Project
text preprocessing before train Natural Language Processing

# Problem
If we do not clean the word in sentence. The Natural Language Processing model will have low accuracy.

# Solution
clean word in sentence before train Natural Language Processing model

# Methodology
Text preprocessing is an essential step before training data in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It involves cleaning and transforming raw text data into a format that is suitable for further analysis or modeling. Here are some common preprocessing steps to consider:
1. Lowercasing: Convert all text to lowercase to ensure consistency and avoid treating the same word with different cases as different entities.
2. Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens. Tokenization can be performed using whitespace splitting, rule-based methods, or specialized tokenizers.
3. Stop Word Removal: Removing commonly occurring words that do not carry much meaning and may add noise to the data, such as articles, prepositions, and conjunctions.
4. Punctuation Removal: Removing punctuation marks, such as periods, commas, and quotation marks, as they often don't contribute to the overall meaning of the text.
5. Special Character Handling: Handling special characters, symbols, or emojis in a way that is appropriate for the specific task. This can involve removing them or replacing them with appropriate representations.
6. Numeric Value Handling: Deciding how to handle numeric values in the text, such as whether to keep them as-is, replace them with placeholders, or remove them altogether.
7. Spell Correction: Correcting common spelling mistakes or typos in the text using techniques like dictionary-based correction or leveraging language models.
8. Lemmatization or Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form to consolidate similar words. Lemmatization aims to obtain valid words, while stemming involves removing word affixes.
9. Handling Rare Words: Dealing with rare or infrequent words that may not have sufficient occurrences to contribute meaningfully to the task. This can involve replacing them with a special token or removing them.
10. Handling Text Noises: Addressing noisy data, such as HTML tags, URLs, or special formatting, by removing or replacing them with appropriate representations.
11. Encoding and Vectorization: Converting text into numerical representations that machine learning models can process. This can include techniques like one-hot encoding, bag-of-words, or word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.
